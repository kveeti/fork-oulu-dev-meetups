## Internal AI meetup
Join us for an evening of AI talks and discussions, while our seasoned and awesome developers share their experiences and insights about latest AI tools. 

## Coding helpers

- [CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
- [Whisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/codewhisperer/)
- [Cody AI](https://about.sourcegraph.com/demo/cody)

There are so much more options nowadays than just github's copilot. Like Amazon's code whisperer on sourcegraph's Cody AI. Or you can just ask chatGPT(-4). 

## Do art! With open source
Stable diffusion for the win. For images and animations. But what is facebook doing releasing their own models?
